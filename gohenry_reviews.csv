My daughter's first day of school with‚Ä¶,"My daughter's first day of school with her card, tried using it at a vending machine and the school registers. But for whatever reason it kept declining. There's money on her card and it's not locked. Trying to figure out what the problem maybe before cancelling, I do not like the idea that she wouldn't be able to eat, because their school is card or apple pay. It's this doesn't work, I think I'll have to do apple pay. I wanted her to get used to using a card feeling more responsibility for herself in budgeting and saving money.",1,Orlanda Patterson,United States,2024-08-16

GoHenry is a good way to educate money management ‚Ä¶,"GoHenry is helping me daughter learn to value of money and to save for the things she rally wants. She is becoming very frugal and deciding if what she wants is worth the price. GoHenery also gives parents a lot of control of how much they can spend and where they can spend,meaning parents have to give permission for the child to shop on the internet.

It's a great use of technology,"It's a great use of technology.It has motivated our kids to do chores around the house, learn about finances (which our public school system doesn't even touch until Junior year of high school), helps the kids learn responsibility, and the debit card is a convenient way to enable our kids to have money when they need it.",5,John,United States,2024-07-08

My nephew is in love with GOHenry!,"My nephew is growing his piggy bank and spending as he pleases, even though there was one hiccup when he tried to buy something and there wasn‚Äôt quite enough loaded onto his debit (only a few cents off, he was on a field trip and forgot that he had cash too, obviously not the app‚Äôs fault)! The app alerted me about the ‚Äúhiccup‚Äù and I adjusted his monthly payment accordingly. It‚Äôs been extremely exciting and useful. Thank you so much! ",5,Holly,United States,2024-06-03
The best tool to teach your child wealth management,"The app and concept are awesome. You can become the ‚Äúbank‚Äù of sorts and monitor the child‚Äôs account and what they‚Äôre doing with it. Apple Pay is amazing as well, but this program allows parents to set savings interest rates and allows goals to be assigned. Really a great tool toward adolescent financial management efforts. I thought I‚Äôd try the trial and quit, because all I thought it would be was a debit card for the kid, but it‚Äôs this awesome program which does cost, but it‚Äôs totally worth 5 bucks a month (what they currently charge me). Try the trial, bet you pay for the service after it‚Äôs up. ",4,Noah Perry,United States,2024-06-27

Good App/ Kid loves,I don‚Äôt like how they just take money from my account with no head up. Has put me in some tough situations.

I love this app,"I love this app called GO Henry. The cards for kids say ""Go _your kids name__"".... I am able to feel connected to them by assigning and rewarding them and saving money for them and someday they will get to reunite with me but in the mean time this app is my connection to them without any real interaction since that's not allowed since after their father died and I fell down a bad path and they got taken and adopted. I'm sorry I'm not able to use this app the way it is intended but it's my way of copingKinda like therapy..so thank you. I love the different styles of cards (thx mr.beast) and how the app gives my kids an allowance and they get rewards and levels up for learning in the app. I hope one day they can actually do all these things but for now it's all I got aside from Acorn app ",5,Brittani Werther,United States,2024-03-31

HORRIBLE EXPERIANCE!!!!!,HORRIBLE EXPERIANCE!!!!!! went through the whole process of setting up an account. Had to enter all my information including SOCIAL SECURITY number. All of my kids information was also required. All that just so that customer service could tell me that it is better to just close down my account. I ONLY have a PO Box for mail and where I live there is 0 mail delivered to physical address due to dirt roads. They said they could not send my kids debit cards to my PO Box so that I was better off just closing my account. WORST part of all is that they have now collected all mine and my kids information which is the ONLY thing they care about so they had no reason to help me any further.,1,Eriberto Ramirez,United States,2024-05-31

Card isn't flexible for kids 16 and older.,"The card for my driving age teens isn't very flexible. They go more places and often at restaurants, convenience stores the card doesn't work.

Just a con,Just a con. They charge you for moving money. They reset settings from manual to auto. They took 30 pounds by resetting the settings to auto.

Card info stolen. No help. Money stolen. ,"I have been using go Henry with my three daughters for a number of years now. My oldest daughters account had 3 in authorized charges on it and we notified go Henry within 10 business days. $100 in total. I cancelled the card, reissued a new one etc. I emailed their customer service like it says to in cases like this. I never received a response. I reached out again and they asked for me to detail which charges, again, and I did. A week later they asked if I reached out to the company‚Äôs that ran the card and I said that I hadn‚Äôt. From what I could tell from online It was a clothing store on the east coast (we live in CA). Their phone number doesn‚Äôt work and they won‚Äôt return my emails. Shocker. A week later I get a response that they won‚Äôt be reissuing the fraudulent funds to my daughters account, they require that card users notify them with 48 hours of any suspicious activity.

Not compatible with all banks and its not accepted everywhere ,"It has been difficult to set it up with my bank (webster) to move money into the child account and after receiving the gohenry card I activated it and wrote down the pin, and the first time my daughter excitedly tried to use it, it was declined and there was money in her account, the pin was correct and the transactions were enabled. Even the store employees couldn't tell why it was being declined,besides the fact the it's a Mastercard and it may not be accepted in certain places. I gave it two stars because my daughter really enjoys the mini games and it does teach her about money which is really nice but the debit card function is a big let down",2,Joe Barbera,United States,2024-05-24
POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE WHEN CLOSING ACCOUNT,"EDITED: WITHIN HOURS OF POSTING THIS REVIEW, A SUPERVISOR HAD CONTACTED ME TO SAY THAT THEIR AGENTS SHOULD HAVE PROVIDED OTHER OPTIONS TO VERIFY/CORRECT MY BIRTHDAY, AND SHE APOLOGIZED. 12 HOURS AFTER POSTING THIS REVIEW, WE ALSO GOT OUR MONEY BACK. I will change the stars from 1 to 3 since we did get our refund, and an apology, but no customer should have to face what we did in an effort to get their funds back. I also think that GoHenry needs to add an option for simply transferring your child's funds to a bank account when too much has accumulated in the child account. The only option should not be to send the money to the parent GoHenry account, and wait for it to slowly be used up through allowance payment (another reason for 3 stars).We used GoHenry for my daughter's spending for nearly 5 years. I was always frustrated by the difficulty in sending excess funds back to my bank account (you can't do it). It can only be sent back to the parent account. Total pain. But... my primary issue is that once we cancelled her account to switch to a normal bank account, we have not received a refund of her $400+. I have tried emailing, chatting, and calling. All of the methods are telling me that my parent birthdate on file is inaccurate (the first I had heard of this), so they refuse to disclose account information with me. Even IF there was some mis-matched info when originally setting up my account, no one there will take the time to help me fix it, and correct the info. Because they claim the info is wrong, they won't speak to me about our missing money, and haven't sent it back. This is infuriating. It seems like this is some back-end scam to not return funds to cancelling customers. I will not stop trying to get our money, but am not sure what else to do.

Terrible financial solution for kids cloaked as education,"We chose to setup GoHenry when it was acquired by Acorns because it was included in our Acorns plan. This is the first and last time I sign up for something without doing my own research, we've had the worst experience with GoHenry - from delays to getting the card, the auto-transfers not working as expected, limited control over the funds, not being able to connect a savings account to transfer money out of, and a terrible process to close the account. If I can sign up online, I should be able to close the account just as easily - not email support, get no response for over a week, and then find out it was closed while my daughter is at the store trying to make a purchase. We couldn't log in via the app or online, but we had no notification as to what would happen to the funds. Eventually the funds were transferred back to my checking account, but we had no way to verify it was the correct amount because our access was removed without warning. The learning videos were really well done and my daughter learned a lot, but there are a lot of flaws with their offering. Not only do parents pay a monthly subscription for the account, all interest is parent-paid, so GoHenry is holding funds yet isn't a bank that pays interest. Kids need to learn how a REAL bank works, if I'm just going to be the one paying the interest I'm definitely not going to pay a fee to do so. The customer support is terrible/non-existent and when it's supposed to be teaching kids financial responsibility, they're constantly promoting featured cards to have kids ask their parents about getting the latest design - why would you want to teach a kid to pay $5 to buy a new debit card when the card they have does the same job? This is TERRIBLE financial education in practice, you're setting them up for bad habits and wanting the ""latest"" design. NO THANK YOU!! If you want to teach your kids about finances, go to the local bank, ask about a child's savings account, and give them real dollars to save/spend.",1,Jennifer Nixon,United States,2024-07-13

DO NOT USE,"We had GoHenry for years and (mostly) loved it. Other than a few glitches and issues where the system would go down for a day or two at a time, it worked. Unfortunately, it really went downhill. They sent us a new card without contacting us first and it supposedly got lost in the mail. In the meantime, they cancelled my son's card - which was still over a month from expiring - without telling us. We had over $900 in the account which we couldn't access. When I called them, they told me that it was a mistake and that I should just wait for the new card. Three days later, I called and told them they needed to either overnight us a new card, reactivate the old card, or cancel the account. I was told the first two options weren't viable so the account was cancelled. It's been 20 days and we still don't have our money. They couldn't just put it in our bank account, apparently, because they don't have our banking info anymore. They didn't reach out to us when they decided they couldn't send us our money back - I had to follow up with them. I was then told it was all just due to a glitch. Then I was told that no, it wasn't just a glitch, I did need to provide banking info again. I asked for a check instead and they said they can't do checks because they're based overseas. I provided them the banking info and asked for a supervisor to call back. I was assured one would call the next day. Three days later - no supervisor call and WE ARE STILL OUT OVER $900. We're now a Greenlight customer. I suggest you stay away from GoHenry. If it's too late for you to do so, I HIGHLY suggest you keep minimal amounts of money in the account so that, if you end up in our situation, you're not waiting a month or more for your money to be given back to you.Edited to add:The response below and the phone call she's referring to came AFTER I posted here and followed up with the Better Business Bureau. Turns out, supervisors will become responsive if you get the BBB involved!Second edit: I don't know how your times are different - maybe because there was a delay since you're not in the US? I honestly don't know. I just know that I was finally contacted by you guys AFTER I emailed (again) and posted here and with the BBB. Given the fact I still didn't have our money (I've been assured it'll just be another few days) and the length of time it's taken, I'm pretty sure that the customer service and overall experience is still the primary concern here.",1,Valerie Martin,United States,2024-05-09

THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I recently encountered a highly frustrating situation with GoHenry, a service I subscribed to with the intent of teaching my 10-year-old daughter about financial literacy. Despite paying a monthly fee of $4.99 for what I believed was not only an educational tool but also a secure platform for her modest financial transactions, my experience has been anything but satisfactory.The core of my dissatisfaction stems from several unauthorized transactions that appeared on my daughter's GoHenry account. Naturally, I expected swift and supportive action from their customer service team. However, the response I received was far from what I anticipated. When I reached out to address these fraudulent charges, the customer service representative's advice was, quite astonishingly, for me to directly contact the companies involved to seek a refund.This response was not only unhelpful but also completely bypassed the responsibility I believed GoHenry had in protecting its users' accounts, especially given that their platform is specifically designed for children. The lack of immediate and proactive support in such a critical matter of unauthorized transactions is alarming and seriously undermines the trust I had placed in GoHenry as a tool for financial education and security for my child.The incident raises significant concerns about the platform's security measures and the effectiveness of their customer service in handling genuine grievances. It's disheartening to see a service, which markets itself on empowering young individuals with financial knowledge and skills, fall short in providing the most basic protection against fraud and an adequate customer service response.In conclusion, while the concept of GoHenry is commendable in its aim to educate children about money management, my experience with their handling of a serious issue like fraud has been deeply disappointing. It's imperative for a service that deals with financial transactions, especially for minors, to have robust security protocols and a customer service team that is both empathetic and effective in resolving such issues. Unfortunately, based on my recent experience, GoHenry has failed to meet these expectations.",1,Stacy Herbert,United States,2024-03-14

We love the this app and debit card‚Ä¶,"We love the this app and debit card system so far and the user experience is really high quality. I particularly like the way we can incorporate family members in the learning process and open the door for more thoughtful monetary gifts. I do, however, have a few suggestions to help make it even better for our family.1. Paced missions - once my son figured out that missions came with a monetary incentive, he became obsessed with finishing them and burned through them as fast as he could without taking much in. I wish the lessons were paced and tied to his activities and age. If the app stopped him from moving forward in his lessons until he reached a specific money milestone, he might be more receptive to the teachable moment. For example, he could be presented with a lesson on saving after a few months of using the app, along with with a challenge to start saving more. Basically, there should be prerequisites for unlocking additional lessons and they should use the interactions and age of the child to provide more guidance. For example, the lessons in the second stage were way above his head shouldn‚Äôt have been available until he‚Äôs within the recommended age range for them which shouldn‚Äôt be difficult since the app knows he‚Äôs 6. If anticipating the needs of so many different children is difficult, thenparents should have the option to lock milestones until they feel their child is ready for them. Then they could be part of an intentional process of parents guiding their kids through money lessons tied directly to lived experiences.2. I struggled a bit in setting up the allowance and tasks along with the allowance schedule. We first got the app on a Saturday and that is my son‚Äôs allowance day. I couldn‚Äôt get the app to send him his allowance same day and we had to wait a week to have it transfered based on his task activity. I wish there was a way to override the schedule at times and ‚Äúgive allowance now.‚Äù Also, I wish we could look back at a calendar of previous allowances to reflect on his wins and challenges.3. Lastly I wish the giving section allowed us to identify a charity of our choice.",4,Stephanie Castilla,United States,2024-01-14

Mostly positive experience but customer service and shipping are subpar,"My girls (ages 10, 11,12) have really enjoyed this ap. They love being able to make purchases for their games online, having the card to use, and being able to monitor their earnings/savings on the ap. I like them being able to have a little autonomy with their money but also being able to set limits and monitor what they spend. These will be very convenient for overnight trips or amusement park trips so I can monitor what they have spent and add money if needed without having to worry about them keeping track of enough cash for several days. I was very disappointed in how long it took for the cards to arrive. Cards arrived MUCH later than indicated when the order was placed and they do not track them, so they couldn't tell me if they were lost/stolen/delayed. The customer service rep(when I tried to contact them about the delayed cards) was very dismissive and not helpful.

If you fixed a couple things I‚Äôd be all in,I like the idea of this app. It has helped us to be consistent with allowance.

Be aware of fraud and their tactics to keep your money.,"I called on July 27, 2023 and canceled our account by phone with a rep in the UK. She said the money remaining on the Go Henry card would be returned to my parent account within 3 to 5 business days. On August 2, 2023 I received an email from them stating that in order to process my refund they needed highly sensitive and private information about my bank account. (See the email pasted below.)Their email did NOT provide a secure way to provide this information even if I wanted to. The option they offered was to email them back - in broad daylight - all my account information or call them and give it to a representative.They already had my bank account information. How else was I paying the $4.99/mo plus putting money on the card for our child?Why did they need me to give them this sensitive information again and without any security measures? They could just send the remaining funds on the Go Henry card back to the bank account that was on file with them.I called and spoke with a rep at Go Henry. He was not helpful and put me on hold a couple of times. He kept saying he was sorry, but they must get my bank account information before I could get my $158 back.I said, no you were able to withdraw the monthly membership fee and receive funds from the bank account on record, you have that information and I am not going to send account numbers, routing numbers, and my bank name in an email, nor am I going to give that private information to a total stranger verbally.I hung up and called my bank here in the US. Once she understood the circumstances she said, no do not give that information in an email or to someone over the phone. She also said Go Henry can certainly refund our $158.00 right back to the checking debit card I used with them. So she affirmed what I told the Go Henry rep. There was no reason they could not send the funds left on the card back to our bank. They did not need account and routing numbers.I called Go Henry back again and what do you know - I got the same Rep as before. I told him what my bank said and he insisted that in order to get my money returned I would have to respond with all the information they wanted from me as stated in their email.Anybody with an eighth of a brain knows it is nuts to send this information in an email or give it to a stranger over the phone. Identity theft is rampant around the world. It's essential that we are vigilant and smart about handing over financial information to anyone.Whenever I've dealt with other companies about needing my banking information that's already on file with them they've only asked for the last four digits of the account to confirm they have the correct account, or my last four social and/or mother's maiden name.This is the protocol for preventing digital theft and fraud.Decide for yourself how you would handle the email I got from Go Henry shown below. Hi xxxx,I hope you are well.In order for us to process your refund, could you please provide us with the following information: Account NameChecking Account Number ACH Number Bank NameTo help find this information, pleasesee your options below: Option 1: ACH stands for Automated Clearing House To find your ACH routing number, first, check your checkbook.

"goHenry's idea of teaching your kid about money will require a forensic accountant, and acceptance of some funny math.","The very first transfer to my daughters account for $25.00 seemed fine.However, on her very first purchase for $7.00 Henry's ""Front end ledger"" immediately showed my daughters balance as being negative -13.00 or so.And I say front end ledger that is provided to the parents and children.goHenry then proceeded on from this incorrect number, while I had been unable to access the account do to some wonky app errors It was not caught right away.My daughter was set to be in my sisters wedding and i attempted transfer of $200 the day before she was to get her hair and makeup done.While this money is directly drawn from my account on a thursday morning I expected it to be available in time.It was not until the 5th day when no money had appeared that I called and learned about goHenrys use of two ledgers on kids accounts while never failing to take a fee While I had to shell put another $200 in order for my daughter to be ready for the wedding, this was the easy part. What I didn't understand is that if this card is to help you teach your kids about money, how do you explain to them that to begin 25 minus 7 is NOT -13.And when I posed the simple question to the folks at goHenry who assured me that both the back end ledger and the front end ledger showed the correct amount.They dodged the question, and it's a very simple one. ""If the account began with an incorrect number, and continued on without adjusting the starting number how could it ever be the correct amount?"" It's funny math. 25- 7 does NOT equal negative 13.ThereforeEverything from -13 forward was incorrect. And then one has to be concerned with two different ledgers, in any event for kids debit cards, or the lack of a cap on how negative goHenry will apparently let a child go.Which as a parent I could have had such a conversation except I did not receive a single text alert for my child's account.Although I would be notified when my fees were taken, or there was not enough in the account for allowance. And then there is the stated purpose of the card which is to teach my child money management However, with this debit cards just a glance at the statement one immediately knows they need a forensic accountant to sort it out let alone teach. And this all occurred over the span of about 5 months or so. Oh yeah and the account was closed in May without notifying me, not that I intended to keep it open. But it's now the middle of July and I still have not gotten the $200 back,excuse me the 175.00 because they took more fees and claimed the account was negative.So if you want to sit on hold for an inordinate amount of time something like an hour and a half when I was 8th in the queue to be stonewalled, by some very polite folks with British accents this is your place. But remember if they have your account info they can take money all day, but ask why they can't put it back the way they took it. So I'm likely going to have to sit another hour and a half just to get my money back.",1,customer,United States,2023-07-12

I wouldn‚Äôt bother wasting your time of‚Ä¶,"I wouldn‚Äôt bother wasting your time or money with Go Henry, my daughter had a similar experience to one of the other reviews. She had just had her birthday and I added all her birthday money from family members to Go Henry. Transactions were coming out then going back in and then out again and a lump sum also disappeared. I emailed, no response, I went on their online chat and they ended it abruptly, I called and waited for an email follow up. There response was poor and full of excuses. Before all of this, my kids complained how Go Henry would increase the cost of a transaction in case they were going to leave a tip or something. The issue is that sometimes they only had the exact money for what they wanted in their account but Go Henry would reject it for insufficient funds. Go Henry is not great for kids and has left my daughter very upset and angry and they are getting away with it.",1,Lillian Raiski,United States,2023-06-14

This started out as a great experience‚Ä¶,This started out as a great experience for my then 14 year old. He would make purchases with no problem. I made sure funds were available before he would purchase anything. Once the option became available for him to add the card to his AppleWallet things went downhill VERY quickly. My son uses his card at school at the vending machines. GoHenry claims that for weeks they were processing payments and not taking the funds leading my son to believe more money was on his card than he actually had. He hasn‚Äôt used the card since realizing his spending limit was negative and the negative amount keeps going up. At this point I just want to cancel the card because I‚Äôd hate to settle the account and these charges aren‚Äôt even valid. Based on the reviews I‚Äôve read regarding the customer service department trying that sounds like a waste of time and a lost cause.

Love it!,"I love the task options and how I can transfer money with a debit card. I also love how hassle free it was to make her first purchase. I had first tried greenlight which made things so difficult. I had to call support while making her first purchase because they immediately put a fraud alert on it and I had to call and verify that it was us that made the purchase. It was just too much which is why I decided to switch to GoHenry.The only thing I‚Äôd change is the option to auto add funds into my parent account on a certain day. For example getting $20 added to my parent account every 2 weeks from my account on file vs. money only being added once my parent account gets below a certain amount.Granted I can add money to my parent account as needed, but it would be nice to have it auto add on my payday so that I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about it. I also like that there‚Äôs an app for both parent and child. My 6 year old can easily navigate the app and check off on her tasks in order for her to get her allowance every week.

Hope you don't experience fraud,"To start with, I would not give them the 1 star, but I cannot leave my review without a star.I just want to warn everyone that if there are charges on your childs card that they did not make, don't expect a speedy recovery of the funds.I reported fraud on my grandsons card on April 19, 2023 and as of today June 6, 2023 there has been no resolution.When I initially found the fraud I tried calling, but it was 7:00 pm on a Friday so mo one was there.I then sent an email immediately. It took a week and a half before my email was answered.In the meantime while waiting for an email answer, I called during business hours and a very nice gentleman helped me. He cancelled my grandsons card and was going to issue a new one & get the fraud claim started.So I'm thinking I'll be getting the money back in a timely matter.Then 3 days later I get an email that it'll be at least 45 days to get my money back as thats how long they give the companies to respond.This is totally unacceptable. I'm not unreasonable, I expected a week or 2.This is total B.S. at this point. There are no updates at all during this time either. I highly recommend that you find some other service because this sucks.And anyone who reads this and is with this company I sincerely hope there is never any fraud on your childrens account.",1,Kristia Marino,United States,2023-06-09

Fraud not addressed after a month!,"Fraud not addressed after a month of fraudulent charges!! My 2 kids have had an account with this company for over a year and everything was ok until one day I got a text alert notifying me that my son's account was $-400+!! I immediately called and wanted it straightened out. I was told that they just found out about this ""glitch"" and were ""working hard to fix it"". There was no block put on the card and over the next week we watched money be credited back and then charged again and again.I called them a week later to find out what was going on. I was told I would be put on a ""watch list"" and when the account was straightened out I would be notified. I asked for my account to be closed and was told that was impossible until it was straightened out. Frustrated I agreed. I noticed they STILL did not block funds on his card so I personally put a block on it to try to salvage SOME of his money. Why on Earth they didn't do this to begin with as any normal institution would I have no idea!! 2 weeks later I'm still seeing charges be attempted to my son's account but as I blocked it they are not gong through (thankfully). I called them this morning to demand my account be credited back and closed. Once again I got the ""I apologize for your inconvenience"" garbage (but the CSR was very kind btw), and there is nothing they can do until it's been straightened out! I was able to cancel my daughter's card and have that credited back to my bank account...... we'll see if that happens.... but my son's is still in limbo.Upon speaking to my bank on the matter they referred me to the fraud department of the FDIC of which I am going to file a claim. As it is under $500 I'm not expecting much but maybe it will flag this company.If you want to use this system to pay your kids, talk to your bank!!

Why wasn‚Äôt the customer aware of these situations and in return my kid almost didn‚Äôt eat because of it. They had no explanation. I immediately cancelled the card. Very much a waste of time.

They can use their card and withdraw money wherever there's a Chase ATM! That was the better option. My time is too valuable to login, add money to the parent account, then distribute it from there!

Terrible customer service if you have a problem,I have had very few problems with the card other than its ability to work with vending machines and is not venmo compatible. However if your child ever loses their card that is where the lack of customer service begins.My daughter lost her card and we immediately reported it lost and they said we will send you a new one.I get an email saying your card is on the way and should be there in 7-10 days.1st red flag. No tracking number and was being delivered snail mail via USPS. My daughter is away at school and needed the card.After 15 days i called and they ssid wait another 5 days.I did.Then i called again and they said sorrry would you like to reorder and i said sure.I said can you overbight it and put a tracking number on it.They said NO.I said can I speak to someone who can authorize this and said no one can.So now they want me to wait another 10-15 days and see whether I receive a replacement card.This is not the kind of customer service I expect from financial i would suggest you not do business with this company.

Such a terrible company,"In order to review this company, I am simply going to summarize my experience with it. I got this card for my 7 year old son for his birthday. I have deposited all his piggybank savings in it and he even got some money sent in the account from relatives for his birthday. I gave the card to him on his birthday. He had approximately $600 in his account and I put in around $200 in my parent account in order to pay him for chores and allowances.2 weeks later on September 30th, his account was hacked. My parental controls were changed. His pin, his spending limits, etc were all maxed out on the app. The approximately $200 in my parent account was fully transferred to his child account. Then there were two charges made on fraudulent Chinese websites that basically drained his account to near zero. After being on hold for 2 HOURS AND 30 MINS to talk to someone at your customer service that day, it took me 5-6 days to get my son's STOLEN money refunded by GoHenry and 10 days to get receive his newly issued physical card in the mail. But they refunded the entire money back to my son‚Äôs account, not to the parent account. I went to the website and the FAQsection clearly states the easiest way is to withdraw from an ATM. That's what I did. By the way, each withdrawal limit is only $100 per day. And it costs me $1.50 fee from GoHenry and $3 fee from the bank's ATM. Then after all this, instead of apologizing for all the inconveniences that was caused to me and my 7 year old, the company freezes my account without talking to me, because I withdrew money from the ATM multiple days in a row. To be frank, I do not even care, because GoHenry is unsafe for my son's funds. After 11 days, I am still waiting to receive hundreds of dollars to be refunded back to my REAL bank account. Use a real bank, not this app....",1,So,United States,2022-10-24

I tried multiple times to contact them via phone and was disconnected after an hour of being on hold. I sent multiple emails only to find out that my security questions were also incorrect. This process has taken 2 weeks and I still have no answers even though I expressed my concern that my bank and credit cards were accessible.

So far I've had nothing but issues‚Ä¶,"So far I've had nothing but issues with GoHenry. I needed to update our address in order to link my debit card which reflects my new address, GoHenry required the address match my state issued driver's license which I hadn't updated yet. I told customer service I had planned on getting an updated one but that in Alaska it can take a month to get the new one in the mail so I asked if my temp would be valid, I was told yes. So I got my temporary card, called in again to update the address and was then told they in fact do not accept temporary ID's and I would have to wait for the permanent one to come in. Meanwhile my kids allowance is continuing to accumulate and so I was told I could use the gift link if I wanted to send them funds until my official DL comes in to change the billing address. I used the links and paid both my kids...who by the way are far more persistent and pressing than ANY debt collector could be. So allowances are paid...or so I thought. Apparently the funds I sent are only seen as ""gifts"" and now the app still shows I owe them allowance money (plus the extras for odd tasks and the educational quizzes they'd done). I've searched and searched but I don't see a way to remove the allowance that the app says they're still owed which is now making it appear there's a debt when I've actually paid them and now I'll have to essentially double pay in order to get back on schedule but who knows how long or how much that will be since I'm still waiting for my ID to come in. I can cancel the allowance...and the tasks...and the learning bonus...but then that doesn't let my kids actually see what they've earned which is one of the main aspects of them learning about finances. I'm just thinking I may have made the wrong call choosing GoHenry and at this point am actively looking for alternative services that may work better for us.",2,AngryInAlaska,United States,2022-10-19

The app is so simple. I just add funds from my debit card onto GoHenry and I can add any amount to my kids accounts anytime and it posts immediately into their accounts. I can even block funds if they‚Äôve had a bad behavior day. I would recommend this for parents. My kids are 13 and 9.

It's only been a couple of months since‚Ä¶,It's only been a couple of months since I received the cards for my two teenagers. It's a wonderful learning tool. I wish I didn't have to set an amount to give allowances every week.,4,Fanysha Kendrick,United States,2022-10-13
A great teaching tool!,"It‚Äôs a wonderful app and parenting tool/learning tool for kids and adolescents. My primary complaints are that it‚Äôs difficult to re-draw (return to your bank account) the money you hold in your gohenry parent account, and certain businesses that sell alcohol (some restaurants/etc) sometimes fail to process transactions because gohenry deems them ‚Äúadult businesses‚Äù. I appreciate the safety aspects of that feature for kids, but it can be a hassle for my teen.",4,Shelle Adena,United States,2022-10-13
Awful awful experience,"UPDATE: As expected, the company replied to my negative review almost immediately. At the same time, I had to wait on hold for an hour to get someone at customer service on the phone. That person and their supervisor attempted to blame my daughter and the vendor for not scanning the card properly. They attempted multiple times and multiple methods and couldn't get it to work. The vendor had no difficulty scanning anyone else's card though (not a GoHenry cards, obviously...there is a reason nobody else has heard of them or used them). They wouldn't even address me telling them that I couldn't transfer money from my bank or to my daughter's card during the same time (there was apparently something wrong with their processing system but they refuse to admit it). I explained I had tried at least 20 times and it kept crashing. They couldn't see it on their side so they wouldn't address and implied that I did something wrong. Go read reviews in the app store, this site, BBB, or any where else they are reviewed. You will see similar reviews. This company is awful. Their service is terrible and their customer service is even worse. RUN! (END OF UPDATE) ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:Awful awful experience. This is the worst, most unreliable debit card you could dream of. Dropped my daughter off somewhere last night, she ordered food where she was, it came, she tried to pay and couldn't. She called me, I went to the app and she had more than she needed, but I still thought I should try to add more...that wouldn't work either. So the app and card were not working and would not do the one thing they were supposed to do...make payments. I tried to call or chat, but their customer service is 9-5pm only. Even if it was open it wouldn't have mattered because I am on hold while typing this and have been for 35 minutes and only gone from 12 to 5 in the queue so I would have had to pick her up before I got someone on the phone. Beyond that every 10 seconds or so their hold recording comes on to try to get me to use the chat, email or FAQ so they don't have to answer my call.This is not the first issue I have had with them. I have had a problem where my daughter couldn't pay her sit down restaurant meal (you know...when they bring you a check after you have already had your meal and incurred the cost) because they consider that an ""alcohol establishment"" and don't allow them to use the card. So it is really comforting knowing that they are protecting my child by putting her a potentially dangerous situation when she can't pay for the food she ate. I didn't ask her not to be able to pay at ""alcohol establishments"" but what I, as her parent, want is superseded by what GoHenry thinks would be best for my child. What you have here is a broken system where the debit card and app are unreliable (I have never actually heard of a debit card or credit card just not working in the first place) and the customer service is awful. They need to choose either bad products or bad customer service but they can't have both.",1,AS,United States,2022-10-13

Lousy task scheduling.,"The ways you can set up tasks is incredibly limited. Especially on Android.AND, the ios app got an update for daily tasks but the Android app didn't. That's bush league.Everyone in the Android reviews is asking about more options for task scheduling. And they keep saying they're ""working on it"", but people have been requesting it since 2019 and they keep saying ""we're working on it"".No, they obviously aren't.They better get their acts in gear or everyone is gonna cancel and go over to Greenlight.

My daughter is enjoying having access‚Ä¶,"My daughter is enjoying having access to her own money and being able to choose how to save, spend and contribute it. The money missions to teach kids about how money works are useful and my child is working through them. I hope that more missions will continue to be added as they were one of the reasons that I chose GoHenry. The savings goals and tasks to earn money are great. We could use a few more icons to represent our goals and tasks and be able to customize them. While I like that GoHenry includes an option for m daughter to give to the Boys' and Girls' Club, the limitation on the amount and the fact that there is only one charity to choose from are frustrations for us. My daughter initially suggested $5 per week and was very disappointed to learn she could only give 25 cents per week through GoHenry. While she willing contributes to other causes independent of GoHenry, we do hope that GoHenry will expand the options for charitable giving to include more charities and at much greater amounts. All in all, the app is pretty easy to use and we like the flexibility of moving the money were we need it on the spot. I have recommended the app to friends and will continue to.",4,OlyMom,United States,2022-08-14

If you can hack the system, you can make it work but it‚Äôs not entirely intuitive.Update to the response below: our kiddo has four parents across two houses (stepparents). The option below only allows for two parents total to assign tasks and check them off. So that means only one parent in each house can actually access the account.

Teaching your kids about financial literacy is critical,"This app really helps me in my efforts to teach my daughters about financial literacy. They‚Äôve learned how to be responsible, how take into account how much money they have available to spend before they spend. For instance, my oldest had to learn the hard way one time. She went to pay for her items at Walmart only to witness her card being declined. Sadly she was quite embarrassed. I had to reiterate to her the importance of knowing her financial standpoint prior to making a purchase. I explained that it‚Äôs better to experience this as a child than when she grows up. Needless to say she never made that mistake again. Moreover, with the spending limit settings it aids me in teaching them about spending in moderation and making a decision about what items are right now items. Sometimes we have a belief that everything is a right now need just because we have the money. Nevertheless that is not the case. The saving feature is really great as well. Although I had to lock the savings because they would move money from the saving just because they wanted a particular item. I‚Äôve been guilty of that as well, because growing up I didn‚Äôt have anyone to teach me about finances, aside from being cheap. Being cheap doesn‚Äôt mean you are financially literate. When you have goals intended for your savings you have to ensure that your not just freely taking money out of your savings merely because you WANT something vs you urgently need something.",5,Felisha Seward,United States,2022-07-07

I needed to have the refund sent to my new account which was not on file..Months go by, emails are NOT responded to, until about a month ago. Which I was informed it would be canceled and $13.10 would be refunded. Where the hell is my other $20? Because the lack of your horrible customer service you all are keeping $20 from fees on an account that was suppose to be canceled MONTHS AGO!!!!! So about a week ago I get another email saying my account is now closed and I will get a refund of $9.10. So pathetic of a company that is suppose to encourage kids to spend and save wisely you keep $24 for an account that was suppose to be close MONTHS AGO! I have requested to hear back from a supervisor multiple times, and I have NOT received a response back. I will never do business with scamming company known as GoHenry. You all are horrible!

Issues transferring funds to my kid's card,"First the positives, I actually fell in love with gohenry. Easy to use, my son was excited to do his chores and learn about money doing the money missions. After a week of using gohenry, I suddenly wasn't able to transfer money to my son's account. It said insufficient funds, but my funds were fine. Contacted customer service 3 diff times, no one could tell me anything, or how long to fix the problem, only that its being worked on and they would reach back out. After 2 weeks of the issue I decided to put more funds on the account because my son's auto weekly allowance still worked and the funds were down to about $4.00. When I added more money it seemed to fix the glitch, I was able to transfer money to his card again myself. I was happy. For a week it worked. But now again, once my funds gets down to around $20, its doing the insufficient funds again and I cannot transfer any money to my son.Mind you I still haven't been contacted by them at all from reporting the issue almost 3 weeks ago. So I am canceling on Monday and will try out Greenlight. Really a shame because I loved gohenry.",1,Neetzaw Hodo,United States,2022-04-10

After that no one seemed interested in even looking at the chore chart or even cared about receiving allowance. Until now. Thanks to gohenry. It‚Äôs really helped keep him interested & excited about helping out & earning allowance in the process. As well as teaching him how to manage his earnings & the best way to save or spend them. He says that ‚Äúhaving his own debit card with money on it that he actually worked for is so cool & way more fun than our dumb chore chart‚Äù. gohenry has made it so simple for parents to add or transfer money to or from their child‚Äôs debit card.

We decided to close our gohenry account‚Ä¶,"We decided to close our gohenry account due to the lack of options to input chores. There was not a calendar but rather we had to input each chore with a day of the week label on that chore. There were not options to decrease the amount of money that we give each task. At least not a reasonable option. Closing the account was easy. We just had to call. Although days later we received an email stating we had to give our bank information to receive the balance. Feeling uneasy putting that information in an email, we had to call back. When we called back even days later because of our busy schedule. We asked why did they not request that information when we closed the account. They had some lame answer that they only close the account and cannot see that information but they can pass on the information to the correct department to process our refund. What? So after giving them our bank information they said it would take 7-10 days to process. Here we are still with no refund. We called again today since our children are getting anxious about not having their hard earned money. They apologized and stated it should take 2-3 more days. So early next week? The saga continues.

Needs Daily Feature,"Overall, we like the app and my 13y daughter has been more motivated on chores and extra jobs now that she can flash a debit card in front of her friends.The reason for 3 stars is the frustration level of setting up repeating chores.The current options for types of chores are weekly and one-time.I wanted to make mornings better (every morning) so I had to create a one time chore: Monday, get up 1st try, make bed, brush teeth. Tuesday, get up 1st try, etc.7 TIMES.She has other daily goals/tasks that she may or may not complete so I had to do EACH of those 7 TIMES.If you could make a chore that repeats daily I would give you 5+ stars.That being said, I have recommended to friends with the above caveat.",3,Jeramy L,United States,2021-05-28

Example: I have my two children on my account, my sister has a card for her son on her account. So on her sons birthday she sends out a gift link. Since my children have cards they want to send their cousin a gift for his birthday but the system prohibits it. They don‚Äôt allow gohenry users to send gifts to other members.

Get Gohenry for your child now; Thank me later!,"Gohenry is helping our daughter learn about money. She is saving and has even volunteered to do a few chores (we are taking it one step at a time). The app is easy to use and to control (e.g. right now, we do not allow our daughter to purchase items online). The gift link option is AWESOME. When friends and family want to send our daughter money, I simply send the gift link. Even better, some of the money goes into her savings account. I cannot say enough about how awesome this app is. OK, last comment (I promise). Regardless of the weekly amount ($5, $10, $20, etc) you can use this card. It does not require the parent to be a millionaire.

I live in Texas my son is only 16. I don't know how people getting in their account. Without their card. This happened to my sons twice. They haven't take anything out yet but just thinking about it can happen got me kind of nervous. My son is in his room right now asleep and someone is in his account trying to take money out at an ATM machine in New York City how's this possible when he has his card and his wallet. I get alerts all the time when money's been deposits and when money's been distribute to all my kids account. This is scary I had to lock his car tonight so nobody could go into his account. Parents be aware the card is not protected seems like it's not safe like a credit card. Safe from scams scammers out there. My kids go online and buy things from Amazon and Roblox.

I've needed to reach out to customer service multiple times through the phone and through chat and the reps I spoke to each time were very helpful, polite, and informed. I would've liked to pick the PIN. It took my child a bit of time to remember it but over all it wasn't too big of a deal.

Great for Intellectual disabilities,I decide to try this for our 11 year old with intellectual disabilities.

This app has been amazing!The visuals are great with large numbers.The line graph for the items she is saving for is perfect as it helps show more vs less.The instant transfer is great.I also love how I can transfer back to me if I need to give her cash instead.She doesn't quite understand the giving yet but we set up to donate to the boys and girls club weekly so she can see it happens anyways and may eventually understand.Adding chores is easy and she often does a chore that I add on.Overall great app that helps her learn life skills and helps me be more organized about teaching them)),5,Angie S,United States,2021-02-25

There may be a work around for this, but it wasn't obvious or easy to implement at a quick glance.Other than that I like how I can keep track of his spending.Great offering overall.",4,Merrill,United States,2021-02-23

Weekly vs. Monthly option,"This may be my inability to read or something...but I would like to award the allowance once a month not once a week. As my child is older, he might want to purchase something that costs more than the weekly allowance and then prefer to just wait until next month. Doling out the allowance weekly made sense for many, but for us, it doesn't. Is that option on the site, and we are just not seeing it? Otherwise I would award it two more stars.",3,customer,United States,2021-01-24
"Terrible, awful, just no.","Terrible, awful, just no.I really wanted this to work for my son. I needed the card shipped to me at the mailing address I signed up for.

Upon talking to 3 different people from customer support, they told me there was nothing they could do to change the address on my account without it first being activated. I can't activate it in the first place. When I waited a few days to talk to the bank after the MLK holiday to change my address, the bank changed my address, however, the GoHenry card still wouldn't process my debit card. I tried a credit card with the billing address as the same address on my son's Go Henry account... and still, nothing worked. He was so excited to get his card so he could start making his own purchases. I was excited too. I wanted this to work but now we're left with a card that won't even activate. It's just sitting here... However, it is a pretty neat design. I'll find something else.",1,Wish it worked out.,United States,2021-01-24

TOTAL WASTE OF TIME,***03/14/2020 UPDATEDEDIT*** I WAS HALF ASLEEP TYPING THAT REVIEW AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY REVIEW FOR THE HANDY APP NOT THE GO HENRY!!! OMG IM SO SORRY!!! NO YALL GET A 5 STAR FROM ME!! PERFECT APP TO TEACH MY DAUGHTER THE MEANING OF MONEY AND WORKING FOR IT AND BUDGETING! MY WIFE HAD ONE BUT LOST THE CARD AND PHONE SHE HAD THE ACCOUNT ON SO I MADE A NEW ONE FOR HER AND I GET THE CARD TODAY IN THE MAIL. THANKS GO HENRY FOR BEING SO AWESOME HAHA SORRY FOR THE MISUNDERSTANDING!!I did 3 jobs and never got paid for them. Customer service said the person who I did the jobs for complained so I didn't get paid. I did the jobs well they just wanted tree work. So I highly recommend you try another app or post on CL and get side jobs that way.,5,Joshua Reynolds,United States,2020-03-14

I had a horrible customer service experience!!!,"I had a horrible customer service experience today. I tried to create a new account and was told my identity was unable to be verified. Usually this is an easy fix and thought they may just need me to provide proof of verification. I started a live chat to determine how to verify my identification and provide any proof needed and was not even assisted I was just repeatedly told that I ‚Äúfailed the verification process and could not have any services with their company‚Äù. I assumed the live chat may have been a bot so I called the customer service phone number and spoke to a representative. It was not of anymore help. I was again told I ‚Äúfailed the identification process as my name and address do not match my social security number. I have provided them with all of my legal and accurate information and have not run into any issues with any other financial institution. I then asked the rep if there was a way I could provide proof of my identification and was told ‚Äúunfortunately not and we cannot provide you with our services‚Äù. This was just an absurd experience and I have never had a company just deny their services without a clear explanation of anything I could do to continue the sign up process. I have not provided them with any false information everything was my legal and accurate information and I‚Äôve had no issues elsewhere. I was also denied when I requested to speak with a supervisor. Beware before doing business with this company that this is what their customer service is like!!!!Edit: to add in reply to the reply from Gohenry. What I‚Äôm trying to explain to everyone involved is that ALL off my information is accurate and up to date on my ID. Everything matches! There is nothing different from the information given and my legal information/ID. Something was clearly done incorrectly on YOUR end as I‚Äôve had no other issues with this at my current financial institution or any other place I‚Äôve needed to present this information to. However you are not even allowing me to provide proof ofMy identification just saying ‚Äúno We cannot provide you with services‚Äù. There‚Äôs NOTHING I can do on my end because as I said I am registered with my correct information, my ID has all of the correct information, the social security department has all of my correct information. There is nothing that should be conflicting. Something was done wrong on YOUR end!!! However you won‚Äôt even attempt to work with me to resolve this like any other company would such as allowing me to submit a copy of my ID, Proof of address or anything like that just giving me a blanket statement of ‚Äúwe will not provide you services because your information doesn‚Äôt match‚Äù. NO I absolutely will not attempt to sign up in the future because your customer service is horrible.Edit to reply: Yes I have read your email and you are telling me that I need to go get my drivers license updated. This is NOT helpful because it is UP TO DATE. It has my current legal name on it as well as my current address. You are also saying it is a temporary ID which is untrue. It is the current Drivers License required by and issued by the state of Ohio. Good luck running a business when you turn away eager and honest customers.",1,Down To Earth Mama,United States,2020-03-09
